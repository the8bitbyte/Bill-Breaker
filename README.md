Bill Breaker is an anti-Rubber Ducky tool, similar to [Duck Hunt](https://github.com/pmsosa/duckhunt) but made for Linux.

Bill Breaker is a shell script written to detect external keyboards as they are plugged in and monitor them for keystrokes. If they exceed a defined typing speed, they are unbound, and ```ondetect.sh``` is ran.

## Installation


```git clone https://github.com/the8bitbyte/Bill-Breaker.git```

```cd Bill-Breaker```

```chmod +x setup.sh main.sh ondetect.sh exclude.sh```

```sudo ./setup.sh```
